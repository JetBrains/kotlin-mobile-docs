There are different ways to get started with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) depending on whether you want to start from scratch or in an existing Android application.

## Start with KMM from scratch

* [Set up your environment for KMM development](setup.md).
* [Create your first KMM application](create-first-app.md) using the IDE wizard.
* [Check the KMM sample projects](samples.md) for inspiration.

## Make an Android application work on iOS

If you already have a mobile application and want to make it cross platform:

* [Set up your environment for KMM development](setup.md).
* [Make a sample Android application work well on iOS](integrate-in-existing-app.md).
* [Get familiar with architectural guidelines for the KMM application](architect-kmm-app.md).
