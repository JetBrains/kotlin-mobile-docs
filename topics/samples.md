Curated list of Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile samples.  

Would you like to add your sample to the list or have a great idea for a sample?  
Feel free to [reach us out](mailto:kmm.feedback@kotlinlang.org) and tell about it!


## KMM Sample

Official sample from Kotlin team. Demonstrates most basic Multiplatform concepts. 
Learn how to configure Gradle to build a simple KMM project with Android and iOS targets, how to share code in common source set and how to use expect and actual declarations in cases when code cannot be shared: [https://github.com/Kotlin/mpp-example](https://github.com/Kotlin/mpp-example)

## CocoaPods integration samples

Official samples from Kotlin team. These samples demonstrate how to use CocoaPods in KMM projects.  
* Learn how to add CocoaPods dependency to Kotlin project: [https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-with-cocoapods-sample](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-with-cocoapods-sample)  
* Learn how to connect Kotlin framework to Xcode project using CocoaPods: [https://github.com/Kotlin/multitarget-xcode-with-kotlin-cocoapods-sample](https://github.com/Kotlin/multitarget-xcode-with-kotlin-cocoapods-sample)

## KaMP Kit
Collection of comprehensive documentation about KMM concepts illustrated with “quick start” app. The app uses a set of popular KMM libraries and has simple set of features you can use as a reference.  
It’s a good place to start if basic Multiplatform examples are not enough anymore, and you want to dig a bit deeper: [https://github.com/touchlab/KaMPKit](https://github.com/touchlab/KaMPKit)

## Moko template

Another great “not-so-simple“ quick start template. It covers Multiplatform Gradle DSL configuration, modular architecture and usage of [moko libraries](https://moko.icerock.dev/). Also, in this sample Views are native, but ViewModels are Multiplatform.  
If you're interested in sharing not only business logic layer, but also a presentation layer, this project could give you some inspiration: [https://github.com/icerockdev/moko-template](https://github.com/icerockdev/moko-template)

## PeopleInSpace

Minimalistic, but powerful sample. It demonstrates how KMM can be integrated with modern UI frameworks, such as Swift UI and Jetpack Compose, goes along with series of interesting blogposts and has a nice bonus - watchOS target usage: [https://github.com/joreilly/PeopleInSpace](https://github.com/joreilly/PeopleInSpace)

## GitFox SDK

GitFox SDK is a library for creating clients application for GitLab servers. It’s a nice example of open-source production-ready Multiplatform SDK. By looking through its code you can learn how to work with network and authorisation, how to integrate your Multiplatform SDK with iOS and even Flutter apps, and how to bypass most popular pitfalls users encounter while working with Multiplatform:

*Fun fact: this project was created by one of our team members, who was a mobile developer before coming to KMM team!*
