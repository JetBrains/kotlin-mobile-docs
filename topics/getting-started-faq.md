There are many ways to start with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile. You can follow our step-by-step guides, browse samples or start using it in already existing projects. This page will help you to choose the right option.

### Q: I’d like to start from scratch and set up brand new KMM project. What’s the best way to do it?
**A:** First of all, check if your environment is [set up correctly](setup.md). After that, use IDE wizard to [create your first KMM application](create-first-app.md), play around with it, and [explore its configuration](discover-kmm-project.md).

### Q: OK, I’ve got my very first KMM app up and running. What’s next?
**A:** Check out our [hands-on tutorial](hands-on-networking-data-storage.md) and take your first app to the next level with Networking and Data storage. Browse through [Multiplatform technology reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/mpp-intro.html) for advanced Multiplatform Gradle DSL configuration, publishing guides and other useful information.
We also recommend reading more about [Kotlin/Native concurrency main concepts](kmm-concurrency-overview.md) - it’s a common pitfall for KMM newbies

### Q: I already have a mobile app, and I’d like to make it Multiplatform! How do I do it?
**A:** Our [guide](integrate-in-existing-app.md) on integrating KMM in existing projects would be a good place to start. It contains step-by-step migration guide along with answers to some common questions, such as “which part of my app should be shared between platforms and which part should remain native”.

### Q: I don’t like to read documentation, I prefer digging through code. Do you have samples?*
**A:** Yes, [we do](samples.md).
