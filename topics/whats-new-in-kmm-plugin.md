Since KMM is now in [Alpha](kmm-evolution.md), we are continuously working on stabilizing the KMM plugin for Android Studio and regularly release new versions 
that include new features, improvements, and bug fixes. 

Make sure that you have the latest version!

## Update to a new release

Android Studio suggests updating to a new KMM plugin release once it is out. When you accept the suggestion, it automatically updates the KMM plugin to the new version. 
You need to restart Android Studio to complete plugin installation.

You can check the KMM plugin version and update the plugin manually in **Preferences** under **Plugins**.
