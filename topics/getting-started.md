There are different ways to get started with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) depending on whether you want to start from scratch or an existing Android application.

## Start with KMM from scratch

* [Set up your environment for KMM development](setup.md).
* Use the IDE wizard to [create your first KMM application](create-first-app.md).
* Dig through the [open-source KMM samples](samples.md) for inspiration.

## Integrate KMM into an Android application

If you already have a mobile application and want to make it multiplatform:

* [Set up your environment for KMM development](setup.md).
* Decide [which parts of your application to share](integrate-in-existing-app.md#decide-what-to-share).
* Learn how to [make your application work well on both iOS and Android](integrate-in-existing-app.md#integrate-kmm-into-an-existing-application).
