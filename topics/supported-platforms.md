* [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk) on ARM32 and ARM64 platforms
* Apple iOS on ARM64 (iPhone 5s and newer), ARM32 (earlier models) platforms, and desktop simulators on both Intel-based and Apple Silicon platforms
* Apple watchOS on ARM64 (Apple Watch Series 4 and newer), ARM32 (earlier models) platforms, and desktop simulators on both Intel-based and Apple Silicon platforms

KMM is built on top of the [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) technology,
