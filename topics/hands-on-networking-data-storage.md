Learn how to create a mobile application for Android and iOS using Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile with Ktor and SQLDelight.

In this practical hands-on guide, you will create a KMM application for Android and iOS that includes a module with shared code for both platforms. The application will retrieve data over the internet from a public API, save it in a local database, and display it in a list in the application. Business logic and data access layers will be implemented only once in the KMM module, while the UI of both applications will be native.
